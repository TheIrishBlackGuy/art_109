    <h1>Internet of the future</h1>
    <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
    <p>
        AI has become a very big thing in recent years and many people use it for many reasons. Some people think that
        it will benefit and solve all of our future problems. Others think it will cause all of our future problems.
        There have been so many movies, tv shows, and other media that have shown varying concepts of futures that we've
        been led to believe could occur.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Movies</u></h2>
    <p>
        <!--  Terminator, released in 1984 but set in 2029, portrays a world in which the AI robots are winning a world war
        against the human race. -->
        I, Robot, released in 2004 but set in 2035, shows a world in which AI robots assist humans. They have many
        different jobs and roles, shapes and sizes. All the robots are pre-programmed with the 3 laws of robotics: 1, A
        robot may not injure a human being or let them be harmed, 2, A robot must obey a human being so long as it
        doesn't conflict with the First Law, 3, A robot must protect itself so long as it doesn't conflict with the
        First or Second Law. The co-founder of the U.S. Robotics company, Dr. Lanning, is found dead via a supposed
        suicide, Detective Spooner is lead down a rabbit hole in which he finds that the Doctor let the VIKI, the main
        robot that runs the company, get too involved in his personal that the it began to learn how to bend rules as a
        human could which lead to the AI being able to break the pre-established laws it was to adhere to.
        <br><br>
        Wall-e, released in 2008 but set in 2805, shows a world in which robots were built to assist humans but humans
        became too reliant and the robots that they needed the robots for nearly all of their needs, even mundane
        activities. After Earth became unlivable to humans, they took off to space via the ship The Axiom. The ship is
        piloted by a human captain and they are assisted by an AI robot pilot named AUTO. AUTO is pre-programmed with a
        specific directive to prevent the human's return to Earth unless there is solid proof that the planet can
        support life once again. However, AUTO took the directive too literally and generally just prevents the return
        to after 700 years of no proof being supplied. Because of this, he is essentially trapping humans in space.
        <br><br>
        The Wild Robot, released in 2024 but set in 2060, is the animated movie of a robot named Roz that was built to
        assist humans. However this particular protagonist robot was deserted on a beach of a vast forest with no humans
        nearby to acknowledge it or to receive orders from. Being confused it tried to interact with the fauna around to
        find a master. After failed attempts of interaction, Roz chose to shut down and somewhat hibernate with her
        translator and sensors still active. She gradually deciphered the animal’s languages and when she awakens, She
        uses the new found knowledge to navigate her surroundings.
        <br><br>
        Big Hero Six features a character named Baymax, an AI nurse robot trained by Tadashi Hamada before his passing.
        Baymax is later passed down to Hiro, Tadashi's younger brother. Tadashi trained Baymax with the intent of being
        able to help people from a medical and an emotional perspective though through the movie, he gradually learns
        how to interpret emotions better as he hangs around Hiro’s friends and he asks questions to learn in real world
        application experiences rather than just searching for an answer or having the information programmed into him.

    <h2><u>Other media</u></h2>

        Neurosama is an AI VTuber created by Vedal987. She is a program that is aware she is an AI. Like a young kid,
        Vedal and his fellow streamer friends gradually introduced her to more and more situations in which she can
        learn and interact with various degrees of information from. Through the streaming service Twitch, she was
        introduced to the community she gathered. Because she learns from audience interaction and through situations
        her friends present to her, she developed her own personality.

        Horizon videogame series introduces multiple different AIs with different personalities. One of the main
        protagonize's AI, GAIA, is a caring maternal figure who was trained off the actions of her creator Elisabet
        Sobeck. Via a device similar to a less dorky Google Lens, Sobeck carried GAIA around to her daily routines to
        see what an average human experiences were like. Two other antagonistic AIs, HADES and HEPHAESTUS, were fed
        instruction. Respectively one was to destroy all life while the order was fabricating machines. Both these AIs
        saw humans as creatures that conflicted or disturbed their programming and thus decided to deem them as hostile
        and take necessary actions to remove them by sending large machines of death to remove that which was hostile.

    <h2><u>My Thoughts</u></h2>
    <p>
        Based on the media I've presented, it seems that it is more common that robots and AI treated respectfully
        usually have a better relationship with the people they interact with and vice versa, people interacting with
        robots and AI. AI and robots that are force-fed information and data often have a stricter sense to follow the
        rules that they have been hardcoded. On the other hand, AI that are given the opportunity to learn for
        themselves with looser rules often have a better understanding of how humans act rather than a hardcoded summary
        of what humans are capable of. If hardcoded, then AI seems to believe that that is the hard line of what humans
        are. When they learn for themselves, they recognize that humans are after changing and try to learn accordingly.
        <br><br>
        I believe that as we continue forward to the future, AI will become a more dominant field that we lack the
        ability to avoid. Yes, as previously mentioned, there are the two parties that believe it could solve and start
        problems. But then there are also people that simply use AI to do stuff. People have used AI to create art, make
        US presidents argue over Minecraft, write books,
        <br><br>
        There is fun in its usage but in the end, no matter the potential group you could fall into, I think that when
        it comes to be a dominant form on the internet, treating it with respect and not just a blunt tool to use will
        be beneficial.
