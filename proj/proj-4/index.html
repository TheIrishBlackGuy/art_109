    <h1>Internet of the future</h1>
    <h2><u>Movies</u></h2>

    <p> AI has become a very big thing in recent years and many people use it for many reasons. Some people think that
        it will benefit and solve all of our future problems. Others think it will cause all of our future problems.
        There have been so many movies, tv shows, and other medias that have shown varying concepts of futures that
        we've been led to believe could occur.

    <p> Terminator, released in 1984 but set in 2029, portrays a world in which the AI robots are winning a world war
        against the human race.

        I, Robot, released in 2004 but set in 2035, shows a world in which AI robots assist humans. They have many
        different jobs and roles, shapes and sizes. All the robots are pre-programmed with the 3 laws of robotics: 1, A
        robot may not injure a human being or let them be harmed, 2, A robot must obey a human being so long as it
        doesn't conflict with the First Law, 3, A robot must protect itself so long as it doesn't conflict with the
        First or Second Law. The co-founder of the U.S. Robotics company, Dr. Lanning, is found dead via a supposed
        suicide, Detective Spooner is lead down a rabbit hole in which he finds that the Doctor let the VIKI, the main
        robot that runs the company, get too involved in his personal that the it began to learn how to bend rules as a
        human could which lead to the AI being able to break the

        Wall-e, released in 2008 but set in 2805, shows a world in which robots were built to assist humans but humans
        became too reliant and the robots that they needed the robots for nearly all of their needs, even mundane
        activities. After Earth became unlivable to humans, they took of to space via the ship The Axiom. The ship is
        piloted by a human captain and they are assisted by a AI robot pilot name AUTO. AUTO is pre-programmed with a
        specific directive to prevent the human's return to Earth unless there is solid proof that the planet can
        support life once again. However, AUTO took the directive to literally and general just prevents the return to
        after 700 years of no proof being supplied. Because of this, he is essentially trapping humans in space.

        The Wild Robot, released in 2024 but set in 2060, is the story of a robot that was built to assist humans.

        protagonist.

    <h2><u>Other media</u></h2>
    <p>
        Neurosama is an AI VTuber created by Vedal987. She is a program that is aware she is an AI. Like a young kid,
        Vedal and his friends gradually introduced her to more and more situations in which she could learn from.
        Through the streaming service Twitch, she was introduce to the community she gathered. Because she learns from
        audience interaction and through situations her friends present to her, she developed her own personality.

        Horizon videogame series introduces multiple different AI with different personalities. One of the main
        protagonize's AI, GAIA, is a caring maternal figure who was trained off the actions of her creator Elisabet
        Sobeck. Via an ear piece, similar to a less dorky Google Lens, Sobeck carried GAIA around to her daily routines
        to see what an average human experiences were like. Two other antagonistic AI, HADES and HEPHAESTUS

    <h2><u>My Thoughts</u></h2>
    <p>
        Based on the media I've presented, it seems that it is more common that robots and AI treated respectfully
        usually have a better relationship with the people they interact with and vice versa, people interacting with
        robots and AI. AI and robots that are force-fed information and data often have a stricter sense to follow the
        rules that they have been hardcoded. On the other hand, AI that are given the opportunity to learn for
        themselves with looser rules often have a better understanding of how humans act rather than a hardcoded summary
        of what humans are capable of. If hardcoded, then AI seem to believe that that is the hard line of what humans
        are. When they learn for themselves, they recognize that humans are after changing and try to learn accordingly.
