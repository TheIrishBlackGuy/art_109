                        Nintendo's all-star cast of combatants is back in Super Smash Bros. Melee, along with
                        a new batch of brawlers ready to tear it up. The sequel to Super Smash Bros. keeps the

                        attacks and various items to knock each other into the abyss. Some new defensive
                        techniques add an even deeper level of complexity to the combat. In addition to
                        traditional battle royale matches, players can select all-new ways to play like Coin
                        mode and Tournament mode. </p>

                        Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets
                        of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to
                        Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his
                        re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all
                        does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice
                        City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money
                        back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way.
                        Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take
                        over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For
                        the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman,
                        a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that
                        sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice
                        City from the air?</p>

                        wizard Agahnim, who seeks to free Ganon from his prison. Armed with the Master Sword,
                        Link travels between the Light and Dark Worlds, rescues the seven maidens, and defeats
                        Ganon to restore peace to Hyrule.
                        <br><br>
                        Four Swords introduces multiplayer Zelda gameplay for the first time. When Zelda is
                        kidnapped by the wind sorcerer Vaati, Link draws the Four Sword, splitting into four
                        versions of himself. Up to four players must cooperate to solve puzzles, conquer
                        dungeons, and collect rupees before ultimately defeating Vaati and sealing him away
                        once more.

                        Four years have passed since the aftermath of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and a great
                        tension now smolders throughout the ravaged world of Azeroth. As the battle-worn races
                        begin to rebuild their shattered kingdoms, new threats, both ancient and ominous, arise
                        to plague the world once again. World of Warcraft is an online role-playing experience
                        set in the award-winning Warcraft universe. Players assume the roles of Warcraft heroes
                        as they explore, adventure, and quest across a vast world. Being "Massively Multiplayer,"
                        World of Warcraft allows thousands of players to interact within the same world. Whether
                        adventuring together or fighting against each other in epic battles, players will form
                        friendships, forge alliances, and compete with enemies for power and glory. A dedicated
                        live team will create a constant stream of new adventures to undertake, lands to explore,
                        and monsters to vanquish. This content ensures that the game will never be the same from
                        month to month, and will continue to offer new challenges and adventures for years to come.</p>

                        Department's idealistic rookie cop from "Resident Evil 2." It has been six years since
                        the destruction of Raccoon City and in that time, the U.S. government has been able to
                        destroy the nefarious Umbrella Corporation. Fast forward to 2004 and players rejoin
                        Leon, who is now a U.S. agent with a top-secret mission. He has been tasked to look
                        into the abduction of the President's daughter and his investigation has led him to a
                        mysterious location in Europe. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find
                        out who or what is behind everything.</p>

                        Gears of War blends tactical action with survival horror and thrusts gamers into a
                        deep and harrowing story of humankind's epic battle for survival against the Locust
                        Horde, a nightmarish race of creatures that surface from the bowels of the planet.
                        Lead war hero Marcus Fenix and his fire team as they face the onslaught of merciless
                        warrior fiends. A revolutionary tactical combat system and breathtaking, high-

                        and real-time lip synching heighten the experience. The battlefield is a lethal place.
                        To survive, suppress your enemy with blindfire, take cover in interactive
                        environments, or use weapons and teammates to outwit your foes.</p>

                        Oblivion is a single-player game that takes place in Tamriel's capital province,
                        Cyrodiil. You are given the task of finding the hidden heir to a throne that sits
                        empty, the previous emperor having been killed by an unknown assassin. With no true
                        Emperor, the gates to Oblivion (the equivalent of hell in the world of Tamriel) open,
                        and demons begin to invade Cyrodiil and attack its people and towns. It's up to you
                        to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to
                        destroy all of Tamriel. In keeping with the Elder Scrolls tradition, players have the
                        option to experience the main quest at their own pace, and there are plenty of
                        opportunities to explore the vast world and make your own way. Numerous factions can
                        be joined, such as the thieves or mages guilds, and each contains its own complete
                        storyline and the chance to rise to the head of the faction and reap further rewards.
                        Oblivion features a groundbreaking new AI system, called Radiant AI, which gives non-
                        player characters (NPCs) the ability to make their own choices based on the world
                        around them. They decide where to eat or who to talk to and what they say. They sleep,
                        go to church, and even steal items, all based on their individual characteristics.
                        Full facial animations and lip-synching, combined with full speech for all dialog,
                        allows NPCs to come to life like never before.</p>

                        The ultimate Nintendo hero is taking the ultimate step ... out into space. Join Mario
                        as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in
                        the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives
                        chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Mario, Peach and enemies new
                        and old are here. Players run, jump and battle enemies as they explore all the planets
                        in the galaxy. Since this game makes full use of all the features of the Wii Remote,
                        players have to do all kinds of things to succeed: pressing buttons, swinging the Wii
                        Remote and the Nunchuk, and even pointing at and dragging things with the pointer.
                        Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he's done
                        before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting,
                        pointing and shaking the Wii Remote. Shake, tilt and point! Mario takes advantage of
                        all the unique aspects of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller, unleashing new moves
                        as players shake the controller and even point at and drag items with the pointer.</p>

                        Going beyond "run and gun corridors," "monster-closet AIs" and static worlds, BioShock
                        creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes
                        into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture,
                        a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a hand picked
                        group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism is no more. Now the city
                        is littered with corpses, wildly powerful guardians roam the corridors as little girls
                        loot the dead, and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn. Take control
                        of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting
                        unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels,
                        explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify
                        your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering
                        you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by
                        Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships
                        with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation
                        graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most
                        detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful
                        choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit
                        the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them?</p>

                        As Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's single player campaign unfolds, the player is introduced
                        to new gameplay at every turn – one moment you are fast-roping from your Black Hawk helicopter
                        after storming into the war zone with an armada of choppers, the next you are a sniper, under
                        concealment, in a Ghillie suit miles behind enemy lines, the next you are engaging hostiles
                        from an AC-130 gunship thousands of feet above the battlefield. Mixed with explosive action,
                        Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare also delivers special effects, including use of depth of field,
                        rim-lighting, character self-shadowing, real time post-processing, texture streaming as well
                        as physics-enabled effects. Infinity Ward deployed a dedicated team from the start to deliver
                        a new level of depth to multiplayer. Building on the hit "Call of Duty 2" online experience,
                        Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's new multiplayer provides the community an addictive and
                        accessible experience to gamers of all levels.</p>

                        In LittleBigPlanet Players meet on a blue and green planet scattered with individual plots
                        – and use their character's amazing abilities to play, create and share what they build with
                        other gamers throughout the world via the Playstation Network. The LittleBigPlanet
                        experience starts with players learning about their character’s powers to interact
                        physically with the environment. There are places to explore, creative resources to
                        collect and puzzles to solve – all requiring a combination of brains and collaborative
                        teamwork. As soon as players begin their creative skills will grow and they will soon be
                        ready to start creating and modifying their surroundings – the first step to sharing them
                        with the whole community.Characters have the power to move anything in this glued and
                        stitched-together 3D landscape; they have the power to design, shape and build both objects
                        and entire locations for others to view and play. There’s no complicated level editor;
                        all of these skills can be learned by simply playing the game. Creativity is part of the
                        gameplay experience and playing is part of the creative experience. Players can make their
                        world as open or as secretive to explore as they like. When it’s ready, they can invite
                        anyone within the LittleBigPlanet community to come and explore their patch – or can go
                        and explore everybody else's.</p>

                        Developed by Rockstar San Diego, as a follow up to the 2004 hit game Red Dead Revolver, Red
                        Dead Redemption is a Western epic, set at the turn of the 20th century when the lawless and
                        chaotic badlands began to give way to the expanding reach of government and the spread of the
                        Industrial Age. The story of former outlaw, John Marston, Red Dead Redemption takes players
                        on a great adventure across the American frontier. Utilizing Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar
                        Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), Red Dead Redemption features an open-world environment for
                        players to explore, including frontier towns, rolling prairies teeming with wildlife, and
                        perilous mountain passes - each packed with an endless flow of varied distractions. Along
                        the way, players experience the heat of gunfights and battles, meet a host of unique
                        characters, struggle against the harshness of one of the world’s last remaining wildernesses,
                        and ultimately pick their own precarious path through an epic story about the death of the
                        Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it.</p>

                        The FIFA video game series, published by Electronic Arts (EA) from 1993 until 2022, simulated
                        association football, offering players a realistic football experience with real leagues, clubs,

                            However, it succeeds at one key task that it sets out to do: render FIFA 12 obsolete. You
                            can wear last year's jersey, but you won't want to play last year's game any longer."</p>

                    <p>"Stardew Valley is without a doubt the best game in the Harvest Moon genre in many years. It
                        has

                        a subtle message about what it means to live a good life and to flourish through a

                        <br>
                        of hard work and human connection. The Harvest Moon games all basically boil down to
                        managing a
                        <br>
                        mix of time, tasks, and metrics, and recent entries in the series have relied heavily on
                        <br>
                        exploiting a new gameplay gimmick with each iteration: in one it's crafting structures for
                        the
                        <br>
                        town, in another it's trading with foreign economies. The problem with this approach is that
                        <br>
                        once these gimmicks are exhausted — all the houses built or all the goods traded — the games
                        <br>
                        feel hollow. Stardew Valley succeeds by delivering a robust experience that does not merely
                        rely
                        <br>
                        on watching a meter go up. It has something to say and says it well, while never abandoning
                        the
                        <br>
                        core gameplay that attracted players in the first place."

                        <br>

                        can't say for certain if there is enough new content here to warrant an additional

                        <br>
                        but if you've yet to play Dragon Quest XI and have access to a Nintendo Switch, this version
                        is
                        <br>
                        truly the "Definitive Edition" that the title claims it is."
